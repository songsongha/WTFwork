# WTF Should I Do For Work?


For all you out there looking to pivot careers but struggling with the big question: If not this, then what? I built a website to help!!

I used the Finstagram site I created as part of the Lighthouse Labs course as the base and turned it into this project :)

This project used Ruby, Javascript, HTML, CSS and includes the following components:
    Web scraping to a database
    Asychronous/multi-threaded programming
    Ensuring complete user inputs using Javascript
    Database query
    Restricting user access to admin areas with secure passwords
    Interactive display changes using Javascript
    Responsive layouts

Always open to suggestions for code improvements!
